#### Target Player Exerience

The player should feel stressed and paranoid. As the enemy is moving throughout the convoluted houses to reach the player, the player needs to find a way to get out and get away. This involves simple platforming and acquiring items to progress further. Throughout this process, the player should grow to fear the presence of the enemy, and have to use their environment and skills to overcome their fears and progress through the game.

#### Core Diagram

1.  Core Mechaninc

    -   Moving through a 2D house in order to locate an exit. This includes simple horizontal movement, jumping, and opening/closing doors.

2.  Secondary Mechancis

    -   Pick up items: items have specific uses that allow the player to progress or give them an advantage. This could mean a key to unlock a door, or a weapon to temporarily fight off the enemy.
    -   Enemy: is always trying to move toward the player, navigating the house and attempting to catch and kill the player. The enemy provides pressure needed to force the player to progress through the levels. The enemy is intended to add to the horror aspect of the game, instead of it just being a puzzle platformer.
    -   Obstacles/Traps: things that will slow the player down and allow the enemy to get close to the player. Makes the player think about how they move around and watch where they step.


3.  Progression

    -   Player will pickup items throughout their adventure. These items may be a one time use (such as a glass bottle to hit the enemy         with), or a permanent boost, such as running shoes to allow the player to move faster.
    -   Each level will be a house (maybe multiple houses per level in later levels). Each house will be more complex/difficult than the         last, hence requiring the player to improve their skills before they can progress.

4.  Narrative

    -   On Halloween night, you go to a house party and really go at it. Later in the night, you suddenly wake up, and find that everyone around you is dead. It is then that you hear heavy footsteps above you, and hear a scream as the sound of ripping fabric and dripping blood echoes into your ears. You can't remember how to get out, but you better figure it out before the killer gets to you.
#### Minimal Viable Interaction

A single level will be our MVI. It will contain a 2D cross section of a multi-storied house. The player will be able to move left/right and jump. The player will also be able to use doors to move between rooms within the house. The enemy will also be able to navigate the house, and will have AI sophisticated enough where the enemy does not simply follow the player, but has small a sense of randomness/human factor in order to keep the player on their toes. The lighting in the world will be dark and spooky, and we will have clutter such as furniture to decorate the house with. There will also have a key pickup that is used to unlock the exit door.

Visual Reference (Darq) - The tight camera and utilization of a flashlight will be used to increase tension and sense of mystery, similar to in Darq.

Visual Reference (Limbo) - The minimalistic art style and muted colors like in Limbo will be used to better control contrast between background, foreground, and important objects (such as items). We may also use a film-grain effect.

Gameplay Reference (Alien: Isolation) - The core tension of our game comes from the high degree of power/control a single enemy has over the player, similar to in Alien: Isolation.

Gameplay/UI Reference - The icons for item pickups and door opening mechanic are similar to the ones found in This War of Mine. Both game also feature puzzle aspects to traversing the building.
