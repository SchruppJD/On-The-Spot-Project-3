#### Core Diagram

1.  Core Mechanic
- Multiple players, all on the same machine, can move around in a 3D room. Their goal is to get to the last room, which they accomplish by passing through all of the rooms. The camera is top-down (but at a slight angle).

2.  Secondary Mechancics
- The players can push each other around by colliding into each other.
- All surviving players must make it to the end of each room. A few seconds after the players enter the room, the ground starts to fall apart, making it harder to be patient, as a player dies if they fall through the room.
- Alive players may set off traps by running into them. Traps are 3D objects that can kill or push the player.
- Players that die in the current room become 'ghosts' in the next room. They can activate traps at will (with cooldowns), and can push living players around. Ghosts are immune to traps and falling. If a ghost kills a living player, they come back to life in the next room.
- Each room contains traps and other elements that create stress and chaos for the players.
- Players may also be able to jump.
3.  Progression
- A player gets a point whenever they kill another player.
- Players also get points for reaching the end of a room the fastest.
- The players move through a series of rooms until they reach a linear end.
- The player with the highest score wins.

4.  Narrative
#### Minimal Viable Interaction
#### References
Gameplay/Layout Reference - The traps and ghost mechanic are similar to the one found in Crawl. Also, the small-room top-down design aspect is also similar to Crawl.
